# Aurora Falls - Completed Items

Consolidated list of completed features, improvements, and bug fixes.

---

## Features

- **Voxel World** — Procedural island generation, transparent blocks, real-time block creation/destruction, block placement preview
- **Entity System** — Pickup entity (`VEntPickup`), NPC entity base (`VEntNPC`)
- **GUI System** — Migrated to FishUI with Raylib backend (`FishUIManager`, `RaylibFishUIGfx`, `RaylibFishUIInput`). Custom controls: `FishUIItemBox`, `FishUIInventory`, `FishUIInfoLabel`. Removed old GUI code.
- **GUI: Main menu title logo** — Added `ImageBox` displaying game logo at top of main menu.
- **GUI: In-game debug menu** — Added FishUI debug window (F1 key) with debug toggle, save/load game, regenerate world, and main menu buttons.
- **Graphics: Fullbright mode** — Added toggleable fullbright rendering via debug menu. Uses `BlockLight.FullbrightMode` flag.
- **Graphics: Lighting calculation fix** — Fixed sunlight propagation (opaque blocks don't emit), cross-chunk light propagation, and early termination logic.
- **GUI: Inventory item box textures** — Added state-based textures (normal, selected, hover, pressed) for `FishUIItemBox` from `data/textures/gui/`.
- **Graphics: Glowstone light emission** — Fixed lighting recomputation when placing/removing light-emitting or opaque blocks.
- **Audio: Block placement sounds** — Added sound effects for placing and breaking blocks.
- **Physics: Jump height** — Increased player jump impulse by 10% (5.5 → 6.05).
- **Graphics: Glass backface rendering** — Added double-sided rendering for glass/ice blocks, skipping backfaces between adjacent same-type blocks.
- **Physics Utils** — Created `PhysicsUtils` class with shared collision functions (`ClipVelocity`, `MoveWithCollision`, `Accelerate`, `AirAccelerate`, `ApplyFriction`, `ApplyGravity`). Enhanced `AABB` with `Overlaps()` and helper properties. Refactored `EntityManager` and `Player` to use shared utilities.
- **Animation System** — Lerp system with comprehensive easing functions (Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint, Sine, Expo, Circ, Back, Elastic, Bounce)
- **Player Movement** — Quake-style physics (strafe-jumping, bunny-hopping, air control, clip velocity)
- **Rendering** — Frame interpolation for smooth camera/position/view model rendering
- **Unit Testing** — Tests for AABB, Easing, Utils, Noise

## Bug Fixes

- **Particle System** — Fixed depth ordering and underwater rendering (physics resistance, blue tint)
- **Transparent Blocks** — Fixed depth sorting for water/glass overlap
- **Unit Tests** — Fixed noise seed test with larger coordinates
- **GUI: Main menu button clipping** — Fixed button borders being cut off by adding padding to StackLayout
