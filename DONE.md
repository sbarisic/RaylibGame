# Aurora Falls - Completed Items

Consolidated list of completed features, improvements, and bug fixes.

---

## Features

- **Voxel World** â€” Procedural island generation, transparent blocks, real-time block creation/destruction, block placement preview
- **Entity System** â€” Pickup entity (`VEntPickup`), NPC entity base (`VEntNPC`), sliding door entity (`VEntSlidingDoor`)
- **GUI System** â€” Migrated to FishUI with Raylib backend (`FishUIManager`, `RaylibFishUIGfx`, `RaylibFishUIInput`). Custom controls: `FishUIItemBox`, `FishUIInventory`, `FishUIInfoLabel`. Removed old GUI code.
- **GUI: Main menu refactor** â€” Refactored main menu to use FishUI `ScrollablePane` with properly positioned buttons, tooltips, and `OnButtonPressed` event pattern.
- **GUI: Main menu title logo** â€” Added `ImageBox` displaying game logo at top of main menu.
- **GUI: In-game debug menu** â€” Added FishUI debug window (F1 key) with debug toggle, save/load game, regenerate world, and main menu buttons.
- **Graphics: Fullbright mode** â€” Added toggleable fullbright rendering via debug menu. Uses `BlockLight.FullbrightMode` flag.
- **Graphics: Underwater overlay** â€” Added water overlay when player camera is submerged (texture-based or fallback blue tint).
- **Graphics: Improved lighting system** â€” Separated skylight and block light channels for day/night support. Added ambient light minimum, sky light multiplier, proper cross-chunk propagation, and per-block-type light emission levels.
- **Graphics: Shadow support** â€” Added ray-traced shadow casting for block lights using 3D DDA algorithm. Entities can now emit light with `LightEmission` property. Added `ShadowTracer`, `PointLight` struct, and `ComputeLightingWithEntities()` for shadow-aware lighting.
- **Graphics: Lighting performance optimizations** â€” Replaced heap allocations with stack-based arrays in `SetPlacedBlock`, added sky exposure caching per chunk, moved direction arrays to static readonly fields, eliminated array allocations in propagation loops. **Additional pass:** Replaced HashSet with flat bool array for visited tracking, replaced per-light Queue allocations with reusable pooled collections, cached chunk world positions to avoid repeated `GetWorldPos` calls, optimized `QueueBoundaryBlocksForExternalLight` with bounding box intersection culling to limit iteration scope.
- **Graphics: View model lighting** — View model now samples light level at player position and renders with appropriate brightness.
- **GUI: Inventory item box textures** â€” Added state-based textures (normal, selected, hover, pressed) for `FishUIItemBox` from `data/textures/gui/`.
- **Graphics: Glowstone light emission** â€” Fixed lighting recomputation when placing/removing light-emitting or opaque blocks.
- **Audio: Block placement sounds** â€” Added sound effects for placing and breaking blocks.
- **Audio: Swimming sound effect** â€” Added swim sound when player is actively swimming in water.
- **Audio: Gun shooting sound** — Added shoot1 sound combo for weapon firing.
- **Physics: Jump height** â€” Increased player jump impulse by 10% (5.5 â†’ 6.05).
- **Graphics: Glass backface rendering** â€” Added double-sided rendering for glass/ice blocks, skipping backfaces between adjacent same-type blocks.
- **Physics Utils** â€” Created `PhysicsUtils` class with shared collision functions (`ClipVelocity`, `MoveWithCollision`, `Accelerate`, `AirAccelerate`, `ApplyFriction`, `ApplyGravity`). Enhanced `AABB` with `Overlaps()` and helper properties. Refactored `EntityManager` and `Player` to use shared utilities.
- **Animation System** â€” Lerp system with comprehensive easing functions (Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint, Sine, Expo, Circ, Back, Elastic, Bounce)
- **NPC Animation System** â€” Added keyframe-based animation for JSON models (`NPCAnimationClip`, `NPCAnimator`). Supports walk, idle, attack, crouch animations. Added `NPCPreviewState` for testing animations from main menu.
- **NPC Animation: Save/Load clips** — Added JSON serialization for `NPCAnimationClip` with `Save()`/`Load()` methods, `EasingSerializer` for easing function mapping, and `LoadClip()`/`LoadAllClips()` on `NPCAnimator`.
- **NPC Animation: Layered playback** — Added `AnimationLayer` class and layer-based API (`PlayOnLayer`, `StopLayer`, `PauseLayer`, `ResumeLayer`, `SetLayerWeight`) to `NPCAnimator` for playing multiple animation clips simultaneously with additive blending.
- **Player Movement** â€” Quake-style physics (strafe-jumping, bunny-hopping, air control, clip velocity, swimming)
- **Physics: Water buoyancy** â€” Added proper buoyancy force so player floats in water instead of sinking quickly
- **Rendering** â€” Frame interpolation for smooth camera/position/view model rendering
- **Unit Testing** â€” Tests for AABB, Easing, Utils, Noise
- **Weapons: Require aim to fire** â€” Gun now requires right-click (aim/ironsight) to be held before firing. Moved aim handling from base `InventoryItem.Tick()` to `WeaponGun.Tick()` override with `IsAiming` property.
- **Particles: Fire effect** â€” Added `SpawnFire()` method with fire textures (1-4.png). Fire rises upward with random drift, semi-transparent, short-lived (0.6-1.0s), shrinks over lifetime, supports initial force/direction for wall impact effects. Added `ParticleType` enum for type-specific behavior.
- **Weapons: Gun fire particles** â€” Gun now spawns fire particles instead of smoke on impact, using the wall normal as initial force direction.

## Documentation

- **Full codebase documentation** â€” Updated README.md with comprehensive architecture, controls, and project status; added XML documentation to core classes (Player, VoxEntity, ChunkMap, Chunk, PlacedBlock, BlockInfo, GameState, PhysicsUtils, FishUIManager)

## Bug Fixes

- **Animation attachment points** â€” Fixed child model parts (hands) not following parent transforms (torso) during animations by implementing parent-child hierarchy in `CustomMesh` with `GetCombinedAnimationMatrix()`
- **Water exit boost** â€” Fixed by applying 15% velocity boost when player exits water with upward momentum
- **JSON model UV mapping** â€” Fixed UV coordinate calculation in MeshGenerator. Minecraft/Blockbench JSON models use 0-16 UV coordinate space that maps to the full texture regardless of resolution. Now divides by 16 instead of texture size. Fixed face UV vertex mappings to correctly map texture corners (UV.Y=0 â†’ top, UV.Y=1 â†’ bottom).
- **Particle System** â€” Fixed depth ordering and underwater rendering (physics resistance, blue tint)
- **Transparent Blocks** â€” Fixed depth sorting for water/glass overlap
- **Unit Tests** â€” Fixed noise seed test with larger coordinates
- **GUI: Main menu button clipping** â€” Fixed button borders being cut off by adding padding to StackLayout
- **Lighting propagation** â€” Fixed struct copy bug in PlacedBlock.SetSkylight/SetBlockLightLevel; fixed opaque block face lighting to sample from adjacent air blocks instead of the opaque block itself
- **Cross-chunk light propagation** â€” Fixed neighbor chunks not being marked dirty when light propagates across chunk boundaries; glowstone near edges now properly updates adjacent chunk meshes
- **Chunk mesh lighting seams** â€” Fixed by splitting lighting computation into reset and compute phases; all chunks now reset before any propagation to prevent cross-chunk values from being overwritten

## Code Refactoring

- **Player class file split** â€” Split `Player.cs` into 6 partial class files: `Player.cs` (core), `Player.Physics.cs`, `Player.Input.cs`, `Player.GUI.cs`, `Player.Rendering.cs`, `Player.Serialization.cs`
- **Chunk class file split** â€” Split `Chunk` into 6 partial class files: `Chunk.Base.cs` (core), `Chunk.Lighting.cs`, `Chunk.Rendering.cs`, `Chunk.Serialization.cs`, `Chunk.GenMesh.cs` (opaque), `Chunk.GenMeshTransparent.cs` (transparent)
- **Particles: Transparent block sorting** — Fixed particles rendering in front of glass/water by reordering draw calls: particles now render before transparent blocks
