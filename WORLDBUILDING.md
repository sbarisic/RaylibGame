# WORLDBUILDING

## High-Level Concept

Aurora Falls - game

The game takes place on a large floating landmass in a science-fiction universe. Although the setting is technologically advanced, the player begins with primitive tools and little understanding of the world. Over time, exploration reveals that the island and its structures are artificial remnants of a forgotten system.

The experience should transition from **low-tech survival → discovery → technological awakening**.

Players should *realize* they are inside a sci-fi world rather than being told directly.

---

## Core Fantasy

The player is stranded on a fractured floating island filled with buried machinery and guarded infrastructure.

Primary pillars:

- Survival through building and resource gathering  
- Exploration-driven discovery  
- Gradual technological progression  
- Defensive construction against hostile forces  
- Environmental mystery  

The world should reward curiosity.

---

## World Logic

The floating island must obey a believable internal rule.

### Recommended Direction: Artificial Habitat

The island is part of a massive engineered structure — possibly a terraforming platform, megastructure fragment, orbital installation, or ancient war remnant.

Structures found across the terrain are **system components**, not decorative ruins.

Examples:

- Gravity anchors  
- Energy relays  
- Fabrication facilities  
- Defense systems  
- Transit shafts  
- Crashed vessels  

Large landmarks should be visible from far away to encourage exploration.

---

## Tone and Progression

The tone should evolve as the player advances:

**Early Game**
- Natural materials dominate
- Unknown metallic debris
- Silent or dormant machines

**Mid Game**
- Powered doors
- Active defense drones
- Energy-based technology
- Environmental anomalies

**Late Game**
- Gravity manipulation
- Advanced weapons
- Reactivated infrastructure
- Large-scale world interaction

Avoid predictable tier ladders such as “wood → metal → laser.”  
Instead, progression should come from **discovery**.

Example: finding a conductive crystal unlocks energy tools.

---

## World Structure

The world is fixed-size but procedurally generated with handcrafted elements.

### Generation Model: Hybrid

- Procedural terrain ensures replayability.
- Fixed artifacts provide meaning and identity.

Avoid fully random placement of important structures.

### Recommended Geography

**Vertical layering is strongly encouraged.**

Example:

- Upper layers — safer, natural terrain  
- Middle layers — ruins and enemy activity  
- Lower layers — hazardous, industrial, unstable  
- Deep interior — ancient core systems  

Falling and height should matter.

Consider internal spaces such as hollow sections, megastructures, or underground facilities.

---

## Enemy Presence

Hostile patrol units guard the island.

Avoid immersion-breaking random spawning.

### Preferred Spawn Logic

Enemies originate from identifiable sources:

- Dropships  
- Fabricator towers  
- Signal beacons  
- Defense stations  

Allow players to influence enemy activity by destroying or disabling these sources.

Player actions (mining, activating tech, power usage) may increase patrol frequency.

Enemies should feel like part of an automated security system rather than monsters.

---

## Resource Philosophy

Crafting should remain streamlined.

Avoid complex dependency trees or excessive material variants.

### Core Resource Types

Use abstract materials that scale across technological eras:

- **Biomass** — plants, organic matter, alien growth  
- **Fiber/Wood** — structural natural material  
- **Metal** — construction and machinery  
- **Crystal/Tech** — advanced conductive or computational material  
- **Water** — survival and processing  
- **Energy** — stored power rather than directly mined  

Most objects should yield a combination of these resources.

Crafting consumes them to create specific items without unnecessary complexity.

---

## Shelter and Building

Building must serve a functional purpose beyond creativity.

Shelter should protect the player from real threats such as:

- Enemy scans  
- Environmental hazards  
- Temperature extremes  
- Radiation zones  
- Night dangers  
- Aerial attacks  

If shelter is optional, players will stop building.

Encourage defensive architecture.

---

## Technology Should Feel Dangerous

Activating ancient devices should create tension.

Possible consequences:

- Attracting patrols  
- Power overloads  
- Terrain deformation  
- Gravity disturbances  
- Environmental shifts  

Players should hesitate before activating unknown systems.

Mystery is more powerful than safety.

---

## Combat Philosophy

Firearms shift the tone toward sci-fi but should not trivialize danger early.

Recommended constraints:

- Limited ammunition  
- Weapon instability  
- Overheating  
- Recoil  
- Inaccuracy  

Power growth should be earned.

Early encounters should feel like survival, not farming.

---

## Environmental Storytelling

Avoid heavy exposition.

Let players infer the past through:

- Ruined infrastructure  
- Broken transit systems  
- Sealed bunkers  
- Massive cables disappearing into rock  
- Half-buried machines  

Minimal direct lore is preferred.

One strong implied history is enough:

> The world was engineered — and something went wrong.

---

## Persistent World Change

The world should feel dynamic and reactive.

Possible large-scale changes:

- Structural failures  
- Island quakes  
- Sections breaking off  
- Gravity fluctuations  
- New landmasses drifting nearby  
- Increasing enemy activity  

Players remember worlds that evolve.

---

## Long-Term Pressure

Prevent the sandbox from becoming directionless.

Introduce escalating tension such as:

- Failing infrastructure  
- Resource depletion  
- Rising patrol density  
- Environmental decay  
- Orbital drift toward danger  

Avoid strict timers — escalation is more effective than deadlines.

---

## Primary Design Question

Decide early:

### Is the goal to HOLD the island or ESCAPE it?

**Holding** creates a defensive, territorial experience focused on stabilization.

**Escaping** emphasizes discovery, ascent, and mystery.

Either path is strong, but the decision should guide future systems.

---

## Design Pillars

When in doubt, align features with these pillars:

- Discovery over exposition  
- Systems over scripted events  
- Meaningful building  
- Environmental mystery  
- Player-driven problem solving  
- Cohesive world logic  

Every mechanic should feel like a natural consequence of the world.

## One-Sentence World Anchor

> You awaken on a floating artificial landmass guarded by forgotten machines. As you salvage lost technology, you uncover that the island is failing — and must decide whether to stabilize it or seek a way beyond.
